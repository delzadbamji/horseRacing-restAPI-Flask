# horseRacing-restAPI-Flask

This app is a simulation of a simple betting platform of a derby race.


Here, you are expected to query a custom-built REST API for a horse and get the details of the horses. 
<If this GET request is not performed before placing the bet, then an error shall be raised>

Once the horse data is retrieved, you can choose a horse that matches your budget and place a bet.
